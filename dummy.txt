so i need to check, if this flow or feature is implemented or not. if not then implement it and if any issue fix that

user signup and get some credit.
user logins and all routes are authenticated by jwt
user will able to update his profile data and fetch it as well.
user will able so see his remaining credit in profile.
user will able to but credit using razorpay
there are some plans for credits which user can fetch and select to buy.
once payment is successfull and validated the transaction credit will be added user account.
user will able to see his credit ulitizations and credit statements in paginated way.
user will able to see the razorpay txn in paginated way.

these should be secure and fail safe.
optimized and performant.
these are basics which should be implemented.
